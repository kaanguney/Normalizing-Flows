# Normalizing Flows

### Implementation 

* Parameters
  * number of hidden layers
  * base distribution
  * bijector count
  * neuron size
  * optimizers 
  * iteration count
  
### Performance Evaluation
* Performance evaluation will be done at the end of the project.
  * convergence time
  * correctness
  * robustness

### Reference 
* This repository is inspired by the great tutorial by [Eric Jang on normalizing flows](https://github.com/ericjang/normalizing-flows-tutorial) and [TensorFlow probability docs.](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability)
